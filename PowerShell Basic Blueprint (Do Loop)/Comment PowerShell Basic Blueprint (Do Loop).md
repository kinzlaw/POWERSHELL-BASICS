# **PowerShell Do Loop on Attune**
---
#### ***This is a Blueprint on Attune of how to run a Do-While or Do-Until Loop in PowerShell***
> ###### - *The Do keyword works with the While or the Until keyword to execute the statements in a script block, subject to the specified condition.*
> ###### - *Unlike the While loop, the script block in a Do loop always runs at least once.*
> ###### - *In the Do-While loop and Do-Until loop, the condition is evaluated after the script block has run.*
