The Do keyword works with the While keyword or the Until keyword to run the statements in a script block, subject to a condition. Unlike the related While loop, the script block in a Do loop always runs at least once.

A Do-While loop is a variety of the While loop. In a Do-While loop, the condition is evaluated after the script block has run. As in a While loop, the script block is repeated as long as the condition evaluates to true.

Like a Do-While loop, a Do-Until loop always runs at least once before the condition is evaluated. However, the script block runs only while the condition is false.
